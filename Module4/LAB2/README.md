# Deploy an MVC Code First App to an App Service Web App

* In the Azure portal, deploy a Web App + SQL resource
* Download the publish profile for the web app
* On your dev machine, open the MVC project in the Module4/LAB2 folder
* Deploy the MVC app using the publish profile for the new web app
* Visit the site and ensure that you can add and remove records from the database
* Optional: Modify the Movie model by adding a new property to the class. Update the app to use this new field. Add a migration and re-deploy the application to Azure. Make sure the app functions property now that the database migration has taken place.
