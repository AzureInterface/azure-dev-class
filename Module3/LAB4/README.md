# Lab 4 - Create VNet-to-VNet VPN

* Use the Azure portal to create two new VMs - one in West Us and one in East US. The portal will set up a vnet for each VM in each region. Make you use seperate IPv4 address spaces for each vnet
* Add a gateway subnet to each vnet
* Add a VPN gateway to each vnet
* Add a connection object to build a Site-to-Site VPN tunnel between vnets
* Make sure you can ping across the tunnel from one server to the other
* Delete both resource groups from your Azure Pass subscription when complete
