# Manage Blobs with a C# Application

* In the Azure portal, create a new general purpose storage account with standard performance and locally redundant storage
* Connect to your dev virtual machine, open the console application project in the Module2/LAB1 folder
* Restore the nuget packages
* Update the app.config file with your storage account name and account key
* Use the code samples to create a container, upload a file to the container, and set meta-data on the container
* Optional: refactor the program to build an interactive utility that will allow users to list blobs in the storage account and upload files into your storage account
